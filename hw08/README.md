## Homework 8
#### Due Wednesday, Oct. 25

------------------------------

Purpose
------------------------------
To think through the design of an application

Problem Statement
------------------------------
Write an application that will combine two images using a "green screen" effect.
Should the three image filenames be input on the command line? Should you prompt the user?
How much control should the user have over the green screen?
How should the user control the merge?

Details
------------------------------
In addition to the usual grading criteria of robust code, internal documentation, etc.,
a large part of the grade for this assignment will be "Ease of Use".
You MUST provide help to the user. Your application will also be graded on the quality of
the image merge. Of course, given bad input images, like those below, your application is
not expected to be perfect.

What to Turn In
------------------------------
Email your program's source code to dannellys@winthrop.edu by the beginning of class on Wednesday Oct 25. Again, please
use the subject line, "CSCI 392 - HW08".
