## Program 3
#### Due Wednesday, Oct. 11

------------------------------

Purpose
------------------------------
The purpose of this assignment is for you to learn Java's image manipulation abilities.

Problem Statement
------------------------------
Write a Java program to read all the RGB values of an image, then write the inverted image to a new file.

Details
------------------------------
The name of the input image file should be entered at the command line. The name of the output image file should be the
input file name preceded by `inv_`. For example, `java image1 source.jpg` would read `source.jpg` and create the file
`inv_source.jpg`.

Required error checking:
- be sure a source file is provided
- make sure the source file name ends in `.jpg` 

What to Turn In
------------------------------
Email your program's source code to dannellys@winthrop.edu by the beginning of class on Wednesday Oct 4. Again, please
use the subject line, "CSCI 392 - HW07".
